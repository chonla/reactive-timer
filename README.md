# Reactive Timer

Setup multiple timers and run them sequentially.

# How reactive timer works?

Once multiple timers are setup and triggerred, time in the first timer will be counted down until zero then the second timer will be automatically triggerred. This will be repeated until the last timer. Reactive timer will be started over.
